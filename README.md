# Weather App

A project bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/).

A simple web application that will enable users to enter a location and view weather details:

* Current temperature,
* Current weather conditions,
* Time till next sunset,
* Chart showing the forecast (min, max and average temperature) for the next six days including today.
